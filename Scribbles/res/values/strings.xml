    <string name="explanation1">Begin by logging in with your username and password. If you do not yet have a Scribbles account, you can create one using the New User button at the bottom of the screen. \n\n Upon logging in, you will see the leaderboard of the top 10 scores among all players. You can play your next turn by touching the Play Turn button. \n\n Your turn will alternate between drawing and guessing. If you have just created an account, your first turn will be to draw. After you finish your drawing, press the Done button, and it will be saved to the server. \n\n If it is your turn to guess, a drawing from the server will be sent to your device. You will have two minutes and ten seconds to guess the drawing. After one minute and ten seconds, the drawing hint will appear. If you guess correctly before the hint appears, you gain 50 points. If you guess correctly after the hint appears, but before you run out of time, you will receive 25 points. If you run out of time, the answer will appear and you will not receive any points, but can return to the lobby by pressing the Done button.</string>
