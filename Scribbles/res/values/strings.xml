    <string name="explanation1">Enter the two players\' names at the welcome screen, and press Begin to start. Player 1 will be the first to draw and Player 2 will be the first to guess. \n \n \nThere is a button to select the pen color, and a small menu to select its thickness. The player who is drawing can draw by touching the area inside the green rectangle. You can press the \&quot;Move\&quot; button to switch to move mode, which will allow you to resize and rotate the image. To return to drawing mode, simply press the &quot;Draw&quot; button that appears while in move mode. When the player who is drawing has finished, press the \&quot;Done\&quot; button and pass the device to the other player. \n \n \nThe guessing player will have 2 minutes and 10 seconds to guess what the drawing is. Enter what you think the drawing is into the &quot;Guess&quot; box, and press &quot;Done&quot;. The hint will appear after 1 minute and 10 seconds. If the guessing player guesses correctly within this time without the hint appearing, they will receive 50 points. If they guess correctly, but the hint has appeared, they will receive 25 points. Regardless of whether they get points or not, after the guessing player finishes, a new round begins where the guesser becomes the drawer and vice-versa. \n \n \nThe first player to 500 points wins!</string>
